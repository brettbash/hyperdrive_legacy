### Partials Structures

The partials for Antlers, JS, and Sass all have sub-folders for better organization and abstraction.

-   _Components_ - The smallest reusable item, such as a button or post item card.
-   _Module_ - This is for a whole layout section that can contain multiple smaller components. For an example: Hero, CTA
-   _Block_ - Blocks are the same type of items as the modules, just that these are meant to be Flex Blocks.
